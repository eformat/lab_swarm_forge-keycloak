= Hands On Lab with Wildfly Swarm, Forge and Keycloak

toc::[]

== Goals

* Understand where to start when building microservices
* Get up and running deploying `microservices` on `Wildfly-Swarm` with `Forge`.
* Build a microservices based application using incremental steps to add capabilities along the way.
* Secure your application endpoints using `Keycloak`
* Manage your application performance with `Hawkular`
* Build `polyglot microservices` by replacing some of the services with their equivalent in `Node.js` and `Vert.X`
* Explore different deployment options of your `microservices` with `Docker` and `Openshift`

== Workflow Overview

While a microservices architecture doesn't mandate using a specific language for implementation we decided here to take a pragmatic approach, we will choose the `Java EE` path with `Wildfly-Swarm`, then later in our demo, once we completed our basic app, we will explore how these services can interact with other services that may be implemented using a different technology such as `Spring Boot`, `Vert.X`, `Node.JS` etc...
But let's keep that for the last section.

=== Workflow 
As explained earlier this path will be implemented using Wildfly-Swarm. If you want to see how to work with other languages, skip to the last section.

== The Use case for this Lab

== Let's get started
In this section we will be following the greenfield path.

=== Prepare your environment
you will need to install the following on your machine:

- [x] http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[JDK 1.8]
- [x] https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.3.6 or higher]
- [x] https://forge.jboss.org/[Forge 3.2.2 or higher]
- [x] http://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/download/?referrer=jbd[JBoss Developer Studio 10 (optional)]

=== Start Forge

=== Setup Wildfly-Swarm plugins
[source]
----
addon-install-from-git --url https://github.com/forge/wildfly-swarm-addon.git
addon-install-from-git --url https://github.com/forge/keycloak-addon.git
----

=== Create a new Project in Forge

[source]
----
project-new --named mylab --stack JAVA_EE_7 --type wildfly-swarm
----

=== Adding your entities, datasources, endpoints

[source]
----
jpa-new-entity --named Book
# Add fields to the Book entity
jpa-new-field --named title
...
# Create the REST endpoint for the entity
rest-generate-endpoints-from-entities --targets org.mylab.model.Book
----

=== Secure the endpoints with KeyCloak

IMPORTANT: You need a Keycloak server running on port 9000 and make sure that the Direct Access Grants Enabled option is enabled for this client

[source]
----
# Configure KeyCloak authentication
wildfly-swarm-add-fraction --fractions keycloak
security-add-login-config --auth-method KEYCLOAK --security-realm master
security-add-constraint --web-resource-name Book --url-patterns /rest/books --security-roles user

# Install the keycloak.json file to WEB-INF
keycloak-install-client-json --server-url http://localhost:9000/auth --realm master --client-id security-admin-console --user admin --password admin
----

=== Enable Application Performance Monitoring

[source]
----

----

=== Putting it all together
You can run all the above commands from a single script. [link]

[source]
----
run hands-on-lab.fsh
----

Let's generate the `uberjar` and run, using either ways:

[source]
----
mvn package && java -jar ./target/mylab-swarm.jar
----
or
[source]
----
mvn wildfly-swarm:run
----
or via your IDE with the `Main` class.

== Extend the Demo with more capabilities
Now we have seen how to implement basic set of services, secure and monitor them, we would like to go one step further with moving those from traditional bare-metal environment to leverage new deployment model and targets. In the table below we explain briefly what capabilities are available in the different target environment to help you understand what you get for free or what you will to bring yourself depending on where you choose to deploy your services.

In this section we will demonstrate how to move the you build in the previous steps to Openshift and how you can benefit from its built-in capabilities.
