= Hands On Lab with Wildfly Swarm, Forge and Keycloak

toc::[]

== Goals

* Understand where to start when building microservices
* Get up and running deploying `microservices` on `Wildfly-Swarm` with `Forge`.
* Secure RESTful endpoints using `Keycloak`
* Manage your application performance with `Hawkular`, and more
* Build `microservices` that talk to each other

== Workflow Overview

Basically there are 2 main paths to chose from, either you start from scratch or you decide to decompose an existing application into a set of microservices.
In the next section we will focus on the former, known as greenfield. Then later on we will explore also how one can take an existing `Java EE` application and adapt it to use `Wildfly-Swarm`.

While a microservices architecture doesn't mandate using a specific language for implementation we decided here to take a pragmatic approach, we will choose the `Java EE` path with `Wildfly-Swarm`, then later in our demo, once we completed our basic app, we will explore how these services can interact with other services that may be implemented using a different technology such as `Spring Boot`, `Vert.X`, `Node.JS` etc...
But let's keep that for the last section.

=== Workflow - Green field path
As explained earlier this path will be implemented using Wildfly-Swarm. If you want to see how to work with other languages, skip to the last section.

=== Workflow - Brownfield

As opposed to the Green Filed path, we are not starting from scratch, rather we are going to focus on keeping our previous investment, and wish the team to stay focused on the same language rather than learning a new one. Again here we will start with Java EE, basing our example on an existing Java EE application that we wish to decompose, while preserving its functionality intact, keep the code untouched and allow the app to benefit from samller footprint and its services to evolve
independently.


== Extend the Demo with more capabilities
Now we have seen how to implement basic set of services, secure and monitor them, we would like to go one step further with moving those from traditional bare-metal environment to leverage new deployment model and targets. In the table below we explain briefly what capabilities are available in the different target environment to help you understand what you get for free or what you will to bring yourself depending on where you choose to deploy your services.

In this section we will demonstrate how to move the you build in the previous steps to Openshift and how you can benefit from its built-in capabilities.

== The Use case for this Lab

== Let's get started
=== Prepare your environment
=== Create a new Project in Forge
=== Adding your entities, datasources, endpoints
=== Setup Wildfly-Swarm plugins
